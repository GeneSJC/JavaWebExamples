1) Set up the Configuration

* Create Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse 
* Add the correct jars to WEB-INF/lib
* Add toolbox.xml to WEB-INF for this example
* Update web.xml with VelocityViewServlet from the Velocity libraries


2) Create your Template

You may want to start coding just raw html first, to get an idea of what you are going after.
Then one you have your ideas, shift them into the template structure

3) Use Template from Servlet

a) For all template tokens you want to set, set them as attributes in the request
b) For any token values that are complex objects, you need to provide getters/setters in those POJOs for Velocity to access the fields
c) Now that your tokens are set in the request, call the template you want to use via a RequestDispatcher, and then forward from that dispatcher back to the page
